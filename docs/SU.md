# Tutorial Set Up

These tutorials are written for a linux operating system, specifically Ubuntu 18.04, with a [number of bioinformatic tools](APP_TOOLS.md) installed.

The easiest way to do the tutorials is to follow the [set-up instructions for VirtualBox](VB.md) and create a virtual linux environment.
This will work for any laptop/computer whether it be a Windows or a Mac computer.

However, you can also install [the tools used](APP_TOOLS.md) in the tutorials on your Mac/Linux and download [the tutorial data](APP_DATA.md) yourself, if you want to.
