One of the advantages of Long-Read sequences is the ability to resolve long structural variants (SVs) in addition to Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). However, the higher error rates of long-read technologies, especially Oxford Nanopore reads, makes the identification of SNPs, os called SNP-calling, challenging.

So far only few tools for SNP and SV calling using Nanopore reads are available. As more tools become available this section of the tutorials will be further extended.
